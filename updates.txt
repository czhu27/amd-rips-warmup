Code Improvements: 
    - Gradient Regularizer
        - Sub Region (bools)
        - Multiple
        - Weight Scheduler
    - Multiple Sources

Experiments:
    - Source interpolation
    - Labeled boundary is *enough*
    - Boundary condition isn't... :o


Questions:
    - How many different sources should we use in our dataset?
    - Is there any more info. we can give boundary?
    
His Comments:
    - Also show video results, show snapshots/pictures (?)
    - < 10 should be good, sources
    - train on 3 datasets, then "crank it up" (eg. 2 at a time)
        - see how the error evolves
        - its doing an experiment (try to see what happens after the fact)
